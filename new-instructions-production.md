Context (use exactly as stated by the user)

None of these is working besides the pending approvals and the dashboard.

It’s not showing who’s online and who’s not.

There are more users that are not showing that are already registered in the database.

When I approved the application in the panel it gave me a 500 error:

useAuth logs:

useAuth.ts:108 ID token changed: taskigo.khadamati@gmail.com
useAuth.ts:116 No user after token change
(repeats many times)
App.tsx:96 Auth state in App: {user: {…}, authLoading: false, isAuthenticated: true, userEmail: 'taskigo.khadamati@gmail.com', userRole: 'admin'}


Apparently it only works for rejection.

Rejection or approval should send a notification to the user that requested the application.

In the header on the admin panel exclusively we should not see the “Become a provider” button.

In the admin user on the admin panel, I should be able to add services how I wish, with images, that will be displayed in the services tab for all users to see.

If the user that made the provider request got accepted, then he will have a new tab in the header that says “upload a service” (or similar) that will make him able to also upload services — add that.

When I see the logs in the terminal of npm start I see the database url not set, which I already put in the .env and in the Render env variables, so should this work on production and not locally, or what?

I need you to be able to remove a user from “become a provider” from the admin panel. I need to have access to many things that of course you should know about.

Add some mock and test services to be able to test the AI to see if he picks them up (check if the configuration for the AI will work for this test) and I need to be able to book services, so add a bookings tab in the header.

Do all these granularly without fail and changing anything. Got it?

Constraints (do not violate)

Do not change or remove anything that already works.

Do not refactor unrelated parts.

Make changes granularly, focused only on the items above.

Keep existing UI/shape; just wire/fix the functionality.

Tasks (implement exactly these)

Fix approval 500

Investigate POST /api/admin/applications/:uid/approve 500.

Add step logs in this exact order and ensure each prints:
admin.approve.start → admin.approve.step {step:'firestore_update'} → admin.approve.step {step:'claims_set'} → admin.approve.step {step:'role_update'} → admin.approve.step {step:'neon_upsert'} → admin.approve.step {step:'audit_row'} → admin.approve.end.

Approval must complete successfully (it only works for rejection now).

On success, send notification to the applicant. On rejection, also send notification.

In the response, include the header X-Action: claims-updated for approval so the client can refresh the ID token.

Fix useAuth token-change loop / “No user after token change”

Ensure after approval when X-Action: claims-updated is received, the client calls auth.currentUser?.getIdToken(true) once and does not loop.

Make sure useAuth re-hydrates user state correctly after token refresh (no repeated “No user after token change”).

Hide “Become a Provider” in admin header only

In the admin panel header exclusively, hide the “Become a Provider” button.

Admin can add services (with images)

In admin panel, add ability for admin user to create services with images.

Those services must display in the services tab for all users.

If provider is accepted, show new header tab

If a user’s provider application is approved, add a new tab in the header (e.g., “Upload a Service”) allowing that provider to upload services.

Show who’s online / missing users

Fix the functionality so it shows who is online and who is not.

Fix the users listing so it shows all users that are already registered in the database (not just some).

Env / DATABASE_URL logging issue

In terminal of npm start you see “database url not set”, even though it’s in .env and Render env.

Determine whether this should work on production and not locally, or vice versa, and fix the detection/loading so the DATABASE_URL is read correctly both locally and on Render.

Remove a user from “Become a provider” from admin

From the admin panel, add the ability to remove a user from “become a provider” (i.e., revoke provider request/role as needed).

Make sure the admin can have access to many things (as implied), including this action.

Add mock/test services + bookings

Add mock and test services so we can test the AI and check if the configuration for the AI will work for this test (the AI should pick them up).

Add a bookings tab in the header and make booking work so these services can be booked.

Logging & visibility (must add/keep)

Keep logging visible in terminal (npm start/npm run dev).

On approval/rejection, log start, each step, end, and fail with name, code, message, stack.

For env, log whether DATABASE_URL is detected locally and on Render (no secrets).

On client, log once when receiving X-Action: claims-updated and when token is refreshed (avoid loops).

Acceptance checklist (verify exactly)

Pending approvals and dashboard continue to work (they already do).

Approval works (no 500), rejection works, both send notifications to the applicant.

Admin header does not show “Become a Provider”.

Admin can add services with images; they appear in services tab for all users.

Approved provider sees a new “Upload a Service” (or similar) tab in the header, can upload services.

Online/offline indicator works; all registered users appear correctly.

DATABASE_URL is correctly detected locally and on Render (no “not set” message unless it truly isn’t set).

Admin can remove a user from “become a provider” from admin panel.

Mock/test services exist; AI picks them up (confirm configuration works for this test).

Bookings tab is present in the header; booking flow works for those services.

Do all these granularly without fail and without changing anything that already exists.
