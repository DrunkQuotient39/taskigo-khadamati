You are a world-class full-stack developer and frontend motion designer. I want you to create the frontend of a premium service-booking marketplace called Taskego (in Arabic: Khadamati). It must feel alive, breathtaking, high-end, and extremely dynamic. This is not just a simple one-page website ‚Äî each feature must have its own dedicated page and be modular, cleanly structured, responsive, and mobile-first.

üñ•Ô∏è Stack:
Framework: Next.js 15.3.2 (App Router)

Language: TypeScript

Animations: Framer Motion, Scroll Effects, Card Transitions, Hover Reveals

Styling: Tailwind CSS 4.1.7 with a bold Khadamati Blue + Yellow theme and Inter font

i18n: next-intl (English and Arabic support with RTL switching)

üî• Visual Expectations:
Full animations (Framer Motion + scroll-triggered effects)

Interactive service cards (flip on hover, glow border, animated icons)

Parallax hero sections with depth

Floating AI chat widget (bottom-right corner, always visible and animated)

Professional layout ‚Äî this must feel like a billion-dollar startup

Multiple pages: each of the following MUST have their own route:

bash
Copy
Edit
/home
/about
/services
/service/[slug] (for service details)
/book
/providers/dashboard
/admin
/contact
/chat (AI support placeholder)
/terms
üåç Multilingual & RTL:
Full bilingual interface (English + Arabic)

RTL switching when Arabic is selected

Dynamic translations loaded from messages/en.json and messages/ar.json

Language preference saved to user profile and cookie/session

ü§ñ Placeholder Chat AI Button:
Floating chat widget on all pages (bottom right)

Animated appearance (open/minimize)

This is for AI assistant integration later using Gemini or local NLP

Chat should eventually respond based on:

Price range

Location

Age group

Needs (e.g., "Cheapest AC repair in Beirut under $30 today")

Smart recommendations & comparisons (e.g., hourly maid vs deep clean)

üì± Mobile + Performance:
100% mobile-first with smooth UX

Fast image loading and optimization

Progressive Web App ready (Tailwind PWA plugin)

CDN, prefetching, caching, etc.

‚ú® Additional UI Details:
Provider pages must have profile sections, stats, and rating displays

Client dashboard should show bookings, favorite providers, wallet, and feedback

Admin dashboard placeholders must be ready

How to feed this into Cursor AI:
Paste this entire prompt in a .prompt file or into Cursor‚Äôs ‚ÄúNew AI Command‚Äù interface.

Trigger it from the root of your frontend project.

Make sure the AI knows it's working in Next.js with App Router + Tailwind + Framer Motion + next-intl.

Use the /app folder structure.
