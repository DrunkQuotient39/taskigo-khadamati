# Authentication System Improvements

## Overview

We have made significant improvements to the Taskigo authentication system to enhance reliability, security, and debuggability. These changes address the persistent `429 (Too Many Requests)` and `401 (Unauthorized)` errors that were occurring on the `/api/auth/me-firebase` endpoint during authentication.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Logging System

- **Request IDs**: Each authentication request now receives a unique `requestId` that is included in both logs and API responses for easier tracing.
- **Structured Logging**: All auth-related logs now follow a consistent format with action, status, and context information.
- **Database Logging**: Authentication events are stored in the system logs table for audit purposes.
- **Error Details**: Authentication errors now include specific error codes and reasons in both logs and API responses.

### 2. Development Fallback Mode

- Added a development-only fallback mode that can decode Firebase ID tokens locally without requiring full Firebase Admin SDK verification.
- This mode is controlled by the `AUTH_DEV_DECODE_FALLBACK` environment variable.
- When enabled in development, it allows login to work even without proper Firebase service account credentials.
- Should always be disabled (`false`) in production environments.

### 3. Firebase Configuration Fixes

- Fixed the `FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` value to use the correct format: `taskigo-5e30d.appspot.com`.
- Removed problematic `&channel_binding=require` from the database connection string.
- Ensured proper handling of newlines in `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` with `\n` sequences.

### 4. Type Safety Improvements

- Fixed TypeScript errors in the authentication routes.
- Added proper type declarations for global objects.
- Implemented safe type assertions for request objects.
- Added null-safety checks for object properties.

### 5. Testing Tools

- Created a Node.js test script (`test-auth-flow.js`) to verify the authentication flow.
- Created shell scripts for testing with curl:
  - Bash version (`test-auth-curl.sh`) for Linux/Mac
  - PowerShell version (`test-auth-curl.ps1`) for Windows
- Added comprehensive documentation for testing the auth system.

### 6. Security Enhancements

- Rate limiting is now properly configured to skip the `/api/auth/me-firebase` endpoint.
- Added proper error codes and messages for different authentication failure scenarios.
- Improved token validation with better error handling.
- Enhanced logging for security-related events.
